    - some employees' name are Captial letter and other are mixed. So I think we need to convert names to lower case or somthing.
        * tolower() will take non-alphabetical characters, so we should just need to iterate over the field.
            could just go ALLCAPS and note that we've done such in the readme. That's an old Database trick.

    - String somtime contains '\n', which make difficult to compare to others
        * implement this kind of code to remove that 
            if (employeeName[strlen(employeeName)-1] == '\n'){
                employeeName[strlen(employeeName)-1] = 0;
            }
